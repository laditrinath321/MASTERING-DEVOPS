2. SETUP SSH PASSWORD LESS AUTHENTICATION TO ALL WORKER NODES / CLIENT SERVERS

USING MODULES:

Ansible modules are units of code that can control system resources or execute system commands. Ansible provides a module library that you can execute directly on remote hosts or through playbooks. You can also write custom modules.

units of code that can be used from the command line or in a playbook task. Ansible executes each module, usually on the remote managed node, and collects return values.

===============================

ANSIBLE PLAYBOOK:

playbook's  format -->    yaml or yml


It uses configuration files called Playbooks written in YAML. 

Ansible modules are standalone scripts that can be used inside an Ansible playbook. A playbook consists of a play, and a play consists of tasks. 


yaml - one of the data structure format to represent data .
       yaml file is used to represent data , in our case ansible configuration data

for ex : 

server details :

name = mcserver1
owner = madhukiran 
created = 8 may 25 
status = active 

----
name = mcserver2
owner = santhosh
created = 8 may 25 
status = active 




diff b/w  XML  VS JSON VS YAML FORMATS :

-----------------------------------
ways to Representation of Data in YAML :

-------------
key-value pair 

name = mcserver1
owner = madhukiran 

-------------------
Array/ List - 

- java 
- jenkins 

Fruits:

- apple
- grape 
- banana
- orange  
-------------------

Dictionary - Set of properties , grouped together

Orange:   
   Calories: 50
      Carbs: 5g
   Fat: 0.1 g
   
   
make sure we are giving spaces properly 
 - equal no of spaces

      loop:
        - git
        - httpd

        - java
        - xyz
        - abc
      tags:
        - install_packages

###    
{{ item }} is a special kind of variable used in loops in Ansible.

=============

Modularization	
        Breaks down playbooks into smaller, reusable, and independent units of configuration.
		
Reusability	
          Roles can be reused across different playbooks or projects, reducing duplication.
		  
Maintainability	
         Makes it easier to maintain and update configurations by organizing them into distinct sections.
		 
Scalability	
            Helps manage complex systems and scale automation as infrastructure grows.
Collaboration	
          Provides a clear structure that improves team collaboration by dividing tasks into specific roles.
